I've created a comprehensive 1-slide demo that showcases the design system I follow for slides. Here's a detailed breakdown of my approach:

## Typography Rules

I follow these specific typography guidelines for slides:

1. **Font Selection**: I use sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Century Gothic) instead of serif fonts for better on-screen readability
2. **Font Sizes**:
   - Titles: 36-44pt
   - Subtitles: 28-32pt
   - Body text: 18-24pt
   - Bullet text: 20-24pt
   - Small annotations: 14-16pt
3. **Line Spacing**: Set to 0.9 (slightly tighter than default) for better readability
4. **Paragraph Spacing**: Use paragraph spacing (6-12pt) instead of double returns
5. **Text Emphasis**: Use bold, contrasting colors, or larger size instead of underlining or italics
6. **Alignment**: Left-align body text, center only for single-line headers
7. **Spacing**: Use one space after periods, not two

## Color Palette Options

I use these professionally tested color palettes with specific hex codes:

1. **Professional Palette**:

   - Sizes: 60-120px width
   - Uses: Vision/mission statements, strategic initiatives

2. **Squares & Rectangles**: Symbolize stability and structure
   - Sizes: 80-160px (width/height)
   - Uses: Project charters, SWOT analyses, content organization

3. **Circles**: Create a sense of completeness and continuity
   - Sizes: 60-120px diameter
   - Uses: Business processes, highlighting continuity

4. **Polygons**: Represent strength and futurism
   - Sizes: 80-140px width
   - Uses: Company capabilities, futuristic outlooks

5. **Curves**: Have a calming effect and represent flow
   - Sizes: 100-200px width
   - Uses: Growth/decline over time, flexibility

6. **Spirals**: Evoke mystery and represent journeys
   - Sizes: 80-150px width
   - Uses: Expansion, connections, pipelines

7. **Lines**: Create structure and direct attention
   - Horizontal: 100-300px width, 2-4px height
   - Vertical: 2-4px width, 100-300px height
   - Diagonal: 100-200px width/height, 2-4px stroke
   - Uses: Timelines, dividers, direction indicators

## Design System Principles

My design system follows these principles:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent typography, colors, and shapes throughout
2. **Hierarchy**: Use size, color, and placement to create clear visual hierarchy
3. **Balance**: Distribute elements evenly for visual stability
4. **Contrast**: Use contrasting colors and sizes to highlight important elements
5. **White Space**: Include adequate breathing room between elements
6. **Alignment**: Align elements to create a clean, organized appearance
7. **Simplicity**: Avoid clutter and unnecessary elements

The 1-slide demo I've created showcases all these principles in action, demonstrating how typography, color palettes, and shapes work together to create a professional, effective presentation design system.
